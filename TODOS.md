# TODOS

Items discovered during development that need attention.

## Bugs

- [x] **Input text contrast too low** — Text typed into form inputs (e.g., "Create New QR Code" modal) is nearly invisible. The text color appears to match the placeholder color, making it unreadable as users type. Affects: Destination URL and Name fields.

---

## Improvements

- [ ] **Investigate URL protocol requirement** — Check if destination URLs require `http://` or `https://` prefix, or if the app should auto-prepend it when missing.
